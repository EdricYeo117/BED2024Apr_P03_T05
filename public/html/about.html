                Our mission is to create a supportive and connected Singaporean community where food insecurity is addressed through collaboration and compassion. We aim to empower individuals and organizations to contribute towards alleviating hunger by providing an accessible platform for both those in need and those willing to help. Through efficient organization and transparency, we strive to ensure that every request for food aid is met with a timely and adequate response.

              <p>We envision a Singapore where no one has to face hunger or food insecurity. By fostering a network of caring volunteers, responsive admins and empowered individuals, we aspire to build a future where food resources are distributed equitably and efficiently to offset the ever-increasing challenges in food security due to Singapore’s unique circumstances. Our goal is to create a model of community-driven support that is intrinsic and can be replicated globally, promoting a compassion society where everyone has access to the nutritious food they need to thrive.</p>

            <div class="card-content">
              <p>The burden of malnutrition in Singapore is not as severe as other countries who are underdeveloped, the unique challenges of being a small island nation brings about a plethora of obstacles that Singaporeans are faced with in obtaining a healthy nutrition. <br>
                <br>Singapore has shown limited advancements in mitigating diet-related non-communicable diseases. For example, 6.9% of adult women and 6.7% of adult men are obese, while lower than the regional average can still be improved. Singapore is on track to reduce prevalence of diabetes in adult women, currently at 6.2%, while diabetes of adult men is projected to increase, currently at 9.4%. (Global Nutrition Report | Country Nutrition Profiles - Global Nutrition Report, n.d.). Additionally, wholegrain intake remains low, below 5% in Singapore, while protein intake remains a concern for elderly. Singaporeans have acquired a palate for increasingly rich and salty foods, with total fat and sodium intake rising (Health Promotion Board, 2022). <br>
                <br>Singapore has experienced a significant increase in crude prevalence of abdominal obesity from 39.1% in 2010 to 43.3% in 2021-2022. Hyperlipidaemia also increased from 26.2% to 28.9%, standardized for age. Hypertension additionally has spiked from 19.8% to 32.4%, across 2010 to 2021-2022 (Epidemiology & Disease Control Division and Policy, Research & Surveillance Group, Ministry of Health and Health Promotion Board, Singapore, 2022) <br>
                <br>Thus, is an apparent and worrying trend of declining quality of health in Singapore, which we aim to combat by at the root of the problem, which is the lack of accessibility to nutritious food for those unable to obtain access to it.
