## Say Hello to NutriAid
### Introduction
We are Team 5 from P03 taking the BED Module for Software Engineering Specialisation under Information Technology (N54).   
This repository is for our assignment.  
  
Our application is a volunteering platform called NutriAid.    
> NutriAid is a web application designed to bridge the gap between underprivileged individuals and volunteers willing to provide food aid. 


### Objective
The platform facilitates efficient and organised distribution of food resources by allowing users to post their requests for help in a forum-like manner, which volunteers are able to accept and fulfil those requests.


This will be achieved through 3 main goals:
1) Providing recipes with information on ingredients required to prepare them, leading to users being eased into cooking their meals rather than opting for takeout.
2) Providing avenues for users to plan their meals, enabling them to structure their meals according to their needs and dietary requirements (such as specific dietary restrictions or intolerances).
3) Providing systems for users to manage and track their ingredients to be able to conveniently plan out meals, further leading to a paradigm shift in their lifestyle to incorporate meal planning into their daily routine.
