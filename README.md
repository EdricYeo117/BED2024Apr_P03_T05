## Say Hello to NutriAid
### Introduction
We are Team 5 from P03 taking the BED Module for Software Engineering Specialisation under Information Technology (N54).   
This repository is for our assignment.  
  
Our application is a volunteering platform called NutriAid.    
> NutriAid is a web application designed to bridge the gap between underprivileged individuals and volunteers willing to provide food aid. 


### Objective
The platform facilitates efficient and organised distribution of food resources by allowing users to post their requests for help in a forum-like manner, which volunteers are able to accept and fulfil those requests.
